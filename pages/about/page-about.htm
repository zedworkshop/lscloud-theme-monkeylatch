			<!-- <p class="white h5">Monkey Latch&trade; was founded by Wilson Tse and Craig Hansen. We developed the concept, design, and everything else from the ground up.</p>
			<p class="white">Monkey Latch&trade; was born through a desire to make using our cameras easier. We wanted to eliminate the frustrations caused by time spent with changeovers between accessories or time spent taking the camera in and out of the bag. We felt there should be a better way to handle our cameras and there should be freedom to use it with any accessory you want - easily and quickly. It should always be accessible. That was the starting point for our project.</p>
			<p class="white">That was 5 years ago and many prototypes and redesigns later we have an extremely compact, efficient and versatile system.</p> -->
