<h4>We believe in our products that we will provide a lifetime warranty on all the products and components.</h4>
<p>If for any reason there is a failure of the products under "normal use" please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact us
<ul>
<li>Include the product name that failed</li>
<li>Image of the failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We will make sure that it gets resolved quickly so that you can be back to using our system asap.</p>

<p>The warranty does not cover scuffing, scratches, dings, scrapes, etc. anything that would be classified as 'aesthetic'. Those are called battle scars and they build character.</p>

Monkey Latch is not liable for any damage caused to equipment, cameras or anything associated with the product due to the use of the Monkey latch system.
